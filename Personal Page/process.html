        <p>This page is for explain the process</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Home Page</h3>
        <h5>The typoligy of this page is Home/Landing</h5>
        <p>The main color/design are based on the Professor's bootstrap labs and the Wonbo Woo's personal website, but I added some personal twist on it.</p>
        <p>First I changed the color to black to fit in to the the scheme i choose: galaxy/space.</p>
        <p>The icon is set into a cute planet like creature and the colour setin cyan-like to make it more welcoming and emerge into the main theme.</p>
        <p>On the header, the line "Hello there,..." is in a very fancy and curly font, this is to attractive the audiences' eye-sight when they first glanced it.</p>
        <p>On the main page, the page has been developed in to two parts, first will be the header, the greeting section, which paired with a galaxy-fantasy background image with a dark tone, to set the colour theme of the whole project.</p>
        <p>On the botton, there are 4 cards that have a dark background and gold (burlywood actuallym but I like to call it gold XD) to make this section look more high-end.</p>
        <p>Each card has their own image, and a line of deciption, and in each card there is a button that will lead the audience to the page it linked.</p>

        <h3>About Page</h3>
        <h5>The typoligy of this page is Content Heavy</h5>
        <p>The background image of About page is lighter, it is to bring a happier feeling to the user, to make the main character (me) look more vigorous and make this page more welcoming.</p>
        <p>At the top of the page I made a constant playing funy video do more welcoming to the audiences.</p>
        <p>The About page is mainly text, to introduce myself as a student and my experiences and skills.</p>

        <h3>Design Page</h3>
        <h5>The typoligy of this page is Photo-rich</h5>
        <p>At the top navigation bar there is a drop down menu at Gallery page, and the dark blue highlight is to remind the user which page they are on.</p>
        <p>This page is to show my past designs for another course and when you click on the image there will be a carousel thta pops up.</p>

        <h5>The typoligy of this page is Form </h5>
        <p>This page is for the viewers to send my emails (not really) if they are interested of my work or about me.</p>
        <p>The little icon at the end of the check box is a link to a website that I uploaded my DND campaigns (but it is a Chinese website called BiliBili).</p>
        <p>That button of the botton continusly uses the same colour theme, make things constant.</p>
